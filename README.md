Take your breaks guilt-free while maintaining system activity. Features physics-based mouse movements that are indistinguishable from real human input.

## 🎭 What is WASP?

WASP (Workplace Activity Simulation Program) is your secret weapon against invasive employee monitoring software. Born from the frustration of being micromanaged by tracking tools and similar corporate spyware, WASP keeps your system looking busy while you take that well-deserved break.

### 😤 The Problem

Modern companies install tracking software that monitors:
⏱️ Your active time

🖱️ Mouse movements

⌨️ Keyboard activity

📊 Productivity scores

🚨 Idle time alerts

Then they have the audacity to call you into HR meetings to explain why you took a 10-minute bathroom break. 

**Enough is enough!**

### 💪 The Solution

WASP simulates natural mouse activity and clicks to keep those tracking demons thinking you're hard at work. Take your breaks guilt-free!

---

## ✨ Features That Keep HR Off Your Back

🎮 **One-Click Activation** - Start looking busy instantly

🆘 **Panic Button (F9)** - Emergency stop when the boss walks by

🎯 **Smart Movement** - Random patterns that look natural
🖱️ **Random Click Intervals** - Variable click timing for realism (NEW!)
⌨️ **Keyboard Simulation** - Optional random keystrokes

🪟 **Window Switcher** - Randomly switch between apps (NEW!)

⏰ **Auto-Scheduler** - Set your "productive hours" automatically

📊 **Activity Counter** - Track how many times you've "worked"

🎨 **Stealth Mode UI** - Dark theme that doesn't attract attention

🚀 **Adjustable Intensity** - From "barely there" to "caffeinated intern"

## 📖 How to Use WASP

### Basic Operation

1. **Start Being "Productive"**: Hit the Start button before your coffee break
2. **Emergency Stop**: Press **F9** if someone walks by (or click Stop)
3. **Fine-Tune Your "Work Ethic"**: Adjust speed and click intervals
4. **Set Your Schedule**: Enable scheduler for automated "productivity"
5. **Take Your Break**: You've earned it!

### The F9 Panic Button 🚨

Can't reach the mouse because WASP is doing its job? **PRESS F9!**

Works even when:
- The window is minimized
- You're on another monitor
- The boss is approaching rapidly
- You're in full panic mode

### Scheduler: The "I Work Regular Hours" Feature

1. Enable the scheduler
2. Set start time: 9:00 AM (when you "arrive")
3. Set end time: 5:00 PM (when you "leave")
4. Take your breaks in between guilt-free!

The software thinks you're at your desk. You're at the coffee machine. Everyone wins (except HR).

### Keyboard Simulation: The "I'm Typing" Feature 

1. Check "Enable Keyboard Simulation"
2. Set keystroke interval (default: 30 seconds)
3. Let WASP press safe modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)
4. Your tracking software thinks you're actively typing!

**Note**: Only safe modifier keys are used - won't mess up your work or type random text!

### Window Switcher: The "Multitasking Pro" Feature

1. Check "Enable Window Switching"
2. Choose timing mode:
   - **Random**: Switch between apps at random intervals (e.g., 30-120 seconds)
   - **Fixed**: Switch at a consistent interval (e.g., every 60 seconds)
3. WASP will automatically detect and switch between your open applications
4. Looks like you're actively working across multiple programs!

**Pro Tip**: Have a few work-related apps open (browser, email, documents) for maximum believability!

## 🛡️ Stealth Tips

### How to Stay Under the Radar

1. **Don't Get Greedy**: Use realistic intervals (not 24/7)
2. **Mix It Up**: Vary your click intervals daily
3. **Scheduler is Your Friend**: Match your actual work hours
4. **Still Deliver Work**: WASP buys you breaks, not a vacation
5. **Be Smart**: Don't tell the office snitch about this

### Warning Signs You're Overdoing It

❌ Running 24/7 without breaks

❌ Zero actual keyboard activity for hours (enable keyboard sim!)

❌ Switching windows but never actually working in them

❌ Same click pattern every day

❌ Bragging about it at the water cooler

**Remember**: WASP is for reasonable breaks, not for gaming all day!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "My tracking software detected it!"

- Lower the speed (be more subtle)
- Increase click intervals (be less predictable)
- Enable keyboard simulation (combo of mouse + keyboard = more realistic)
- Enable window switching with random timing (looks like real work)
- Use scheduler (match real work patterns)
- Have actual work apps open to switch between
- Ensure you're still actually working sometimes

### "Windows keep switching and interrupting me!"

- Increase the minimum interval in random mode
- Use fixed timing mode with longer intervals
- Temporarily disable window switching when doing focused work
- Press F9 to stop everything instantly

### "F9 isn't working!"

- Check if another app is using F9
- Run as administrator (Windows)
- Try clicking Stop (if you can catch it!)

### "I got called to HR anyway!"

- Were you running it 24/7? (Don't do that)
- Are you actually delivering work? (WASP ≠ job performance)
- Time to polish that resume? (Probably)

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: Using software to move your mouse? Yes. Check your employment contract for specifics.

**Q: Will I get fired?**  
A: Not if you're smart about it. Still deliver your work, just take reasonable breaks.

**Q: Can tracking software detect this?**  
A: WASP simulates natural movement. But don't push your luck with 24/7 usage.

**Q: Isn't this unethical?**  
A: Is micromanaging employees unethical? We think treating workers like humans matters more.

**Q: What if I work from home?**  
A: Perfect! Use it for lunch, household chores, or that quick nap you need.

## 🎭 Easter Egg

If you're from HR reading this: Hi! 👋 

Maybe instead of monitoring every mouse click, you could try:
- Trusting your employees
- Measuring actual output, not screen time
- Creating a healthy work environment
- Not treating adults like kindergarteners

Just a thought! 😊
